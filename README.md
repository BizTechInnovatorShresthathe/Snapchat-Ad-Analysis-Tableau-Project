# Snapchat-Ad-Analysis-Tableau-Project

Business Problem: The business problem addressed in this Tableau data visualization project was to analyze Snapchat ads and their impact on users. The project aimed to understand how ads are targeting users, the timing of ad targeting, who is paying for the ads, and whether users should be concerned about their ad experiences. 

Project Solution: To tackle this problem, a vast amount of datasets related to Snapchat ads were collected and analyzed. Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, was used to create more than 13 sheets, each focusing on different aspects of ad targeting. Various charts and analyses, including demographic analysis, targeting patterns, and payment sources, were incorporated to develop a comprehensive and insightful dashboard.

The dashboard provided in-depth insights into how ads were targeting Snapchat users, revealing the specific demographics and timing of the ads. It also shed light on the entities paying for the ads and allowed users to evaluate any potential concerns regarding their ad experiences. The visualizations and analyses enabled stakeholders to understand the dynamics of Snapchat ads and make informed decisions based on the insights gained.

By leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, this project provided a visual and interactive representation of Snapchat ad analysis. The findings and recommendations derived from the project's analyses were summarized and presented through the comprehensive dashboard, offering valuable insights into the targeting strategies employed by Snapchat and the implications for users..![dd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/121448188/229526065-5bc839f3-97d3-4d3b-9601-19c66945360a.png)
